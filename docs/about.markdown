The PacNOG 33 mini-Internet demo is a hands-on tutorial that provides
participants with an opportunity to configure a simulated Internet.
The tutorial is designed to help participants understand the basic concepts
of routing, peering, and traffic engineering in a simulated environment.

The tutorial is based on the original mini-Internet project developed by the
team at ETH Zurich: [mini-Internet project](https://github.com/nsg-ethz/mini_internet_project)

The tutorial and instructions are based on the 2022 routing project, which is part
of the [Communication Networks Course](https://comm-net.ethz.ch/) at ETH taught
by Prof. Laurent Vanbever from the [Networked Systems Group](https://nsg.ee.ethz.ch/).

The content has been modified for a smaller tutorial environment.
