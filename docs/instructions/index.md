# Instructions Overview

In the mini-Internet project, you will build and operate your very own
mini-Internet together with other participants.
The end goals is to enable end-to-end connectivity across all the ASes,
composed of hundreds of network devices.

To reach Internet-wide connectivity, you will need to configure the following:

- [Data Center connectivity](intra-domain connectivity)
- [Intra-domain routing](intra-domain routing)
- [Inter-domain routing](inter-domain routing)

To help you, we have pre-built a base network topology on top of virtual
layer-2 switches, running Open vSwitch, and virtual routers, running FRRouting.
